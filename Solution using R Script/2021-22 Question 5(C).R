#Problem I am trying to solve:

#2021-22 Q5(C):

#(c) Let X1 and X2 be independent random variables each having the probability distribution:
#f(x)={e^(âˆ’x),when x>0, 0 elsewhere}
#Show that the random variables Y1 and Y2 are independent when Y1 = X1 + X2 and Y2 = X1/( X1 + X2)

P(x1,x2) = e^(-(x1,x2))
y1=x1+x2
