#Problem I am trying to solve:

#2021-22 Q1(D):

#An automobile manufacturer is concerned about a possible recall of its bestselling
#four-door sedan. If there were a recall, there is a probability of 0.25 of a defect
#in the brake system, 0.18 of a defect in the transmission, 0.17 of a defect in the fuel
#system, and 0.40 of a defect in some other area.
#(i) What is the probability that the defect is the brakes or the fueling system if the
#probability of defects in both systems simultaneously is 0.I5?
#(ii) What is the probability that there are no defects in either the brakes or the
#fueling system?
