#Problem I am trying to solve:

#2021-22 Q2(B):

#A rare disease exists with which only I in 500 is affected. A test for the disease
#exists, but of course it is not infallible. A correct positive result 
#(patient actually has the disease) occurs 95% of the time, while a false positive 
#result (patient does not have the disease) occurs I% of the time. 
#If a randomly selected individual is tested and the result is positive, 
#what is the probability that the individual has the disease?
