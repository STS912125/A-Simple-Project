## What This Is About

Welcome to my project repository! This is where I document my journey of learning R while solving past exam questions from a statistics course. The project combines two of my goals: mastering statistical concepts and building programming skills. This project started as a way to prepare for a statistics course, but it turned into much more. I decided to solve past exam questions using R, a programming language I was completely new to. I didn’t want to pay for an expensive course, so I used ChatGPT as my guide to learn R while working through real problems. Along the way, I’ve been learning, troubleshooting, and building something I’m proud of.

## Why I Started This

I wanted this project to achieve two things. I wanted to learn R by doing. Instead of watching tutorials or reading theory, I wanted to jump right in. I knew I could learn this myself with some help. ChatGPT became my virtual tutor, answering my questions, explaining code, and even helping me debug. This self-driven approach gave me the freedom to learn at my own pace, ask unlimited questions, and explore concepts I was curious about.

## How I’m Tackling the Project

I picked past exam problems to solve. For every question, I Broke the problem into steps.Iasked ChatGPT for help with R syntax, functions, and debugging. Experimented with the code until I understood both the math and the programming.I’ve been leaving comments in my scripts to explain my thought process and what I learned along the way.

## How This Works

This repository contains:
  - A folder where I've kept questions from past term-final exams from my statistics course.
  - My R script solutions, where I use R to solve each question step by step.

## What’s Next?

This is still an ongoing project, and I have big plans for its future:
- Solve more advanced questions, including regression and ANOVA.
- Rearrange my R scripts for better readability and re usability.
- Explore advanced Markdown formatting and R notebooks for improved documentation.
